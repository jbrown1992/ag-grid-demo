✅ Frontend & React Skill-Building Ideas
1. Implement Column-Level Features in AG Grid

AG Grid is incredibly powerful—show that you can use it well.

Sorting, filtering, grouping

Column resizing and pinning

Custom cell renderers (e.g., red/green % change formatting)

Conditional styling (e.g., highlight negative revenue)

Row virtualization and pagination

AG Grid Charts (if you want to go deeper)

This is extremely relevant for finance apps.

2. Create a “Ticker Search” with Autocomplete

Improve your text input by adding:

Debounced search

Dropdown suggestions using mock API

Highlight matched text

Keyboard navigation (↑ ↓ Enter)

This is a huge UX milestone and great for interviews.

3. Add Error Handling & Loading States

Most juniors skip this. Seniors don’t.

Loading spinners

Retry buttons

Graceful errors for missing ticker or timeout

Skeleton UI for AG Grid

Makes the app feel real.

4. Add React Query (TanStack Query)

Perfect for a project that hits an API—even a mock one.

You’ll learn:

Caching

Query invalidation

Handling stale data

Automatic refetching

This is modern React at its best.

5. Use Context or Zustand for Global State

Useful for:

Selected ticker

Theme

User preferences (e.g., table density)

Zustand is especially popular in modern React apps.

🎨 UI/UX Expansions
6. Light/Dark Mode Toggle

Finance dashboards love dark mode.

Store user preference

Use CSS variables

Make AG Grid switch themes too

7. Basic Layout System

Nav bar

Sidebar

Responsive grid layout for charts + tables

Mobile-friendly table collapse

The more polished the layout, the better for your portfolio.

📈 Finance-Specific Skill Builders
8. Create a “Metrics” Panel With Calculated Fields

From the mock statements, compute:

P/E, P/S, P/B

Gross margin, net margin

YoY growth rates

Free cash flow

You’ll practice:

Derived state

Memoization (useMemo)

Financial reasoning

9. Add Comparison Mode

Compare multiple tickers side-by-side.

Grid with one column per symbol

Color-coded changes

Sparkline chart per ticker

This is a standard feature in real tools.

10. Mini Charting Additions

Use something like Recharts or Chart.js.

Add a sparkline next to each row in AG Grid

Add volume bars under price

Add moving averages (SMA 50 / 200)

Even using mock data, you’ll improve your charting skills.

🧪 Testing & QA Practice
11. Add Unit + Integration Tests

Use:

Jest

React Testing Library

MSW for mocking API calls

Test:

Ticker search

API handling

Table sorting

Router navigation

Since you work in QA + backend, this will showcase real discipline.

🧱 Backend Simulation / Fullstack
12. Build a Tiny Node/Express Mock API

Even if everything is hardcoded, this gives you:

Routing

Request validation

Pagination simulation

Delay + error simulation

Helps you learn how frontend interacts with real APIs.

13. Add WebSocket “Live Price” Updates

Mock it.

Use a WebSocket server

Push random price ticks

Update a “live price” widget

Great real-world skill—finance apps use websockets constantly.

🔒 Bonus: Add Caching + LocalStorage

Store:

Last viewed ticker

Theme preference

Recently searched tickers

Grid column state

AG Grid supports “column state” saving; this is very realistic.

⭐ Recommended Learning Roadmap (Sorted by Value)

Autocomplete search + React Query

AG Grid custom cells + formatting + dark mode

Zustand global state

Mock backend with Node + MSW tests

Comparison mode + chart enhancements

If you want, I can also:

✅ Help you structure this as a clean folder layout
✅ Write boilerplate for your AG Grid tables
✅ Generate mock financial statements
✅ Make a full GitHub-ready README
✅ Help you choose component library (MUI, shadcn/ui, etc.)
